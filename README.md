# Movies-ETL
#Overview
I was tasked with sifting through data for movies and their ratings. The overall data was a mess so I had to clean, merge, and align the data from the different csv files.
#Results
After the clean up and overhaul of the data from the ratings, kraggle movie data, and wikipedia movies json files, I was able to confirm that the movies table has a total of 6,052 columns, and the ratings table has 24,289 columns.
